    News detective is a community of people who want to stop the spread of misinformation. And also like to win at
        arguments online. Either way, really. </p>

      <p>  If you have the News Detective Chrome extension, articles
        on Facebook, Twitter, and Google will display truthfulness scores — a "Pscore" (for the publication score)
        and an "Ascore" (for the article score). We, the community, factcheck and rate these articles, and that's
        where the scores come from. </p>

    How do I factcheck?

    </h1Class>
    <p>
    Factchecking is objective, quick, and not hard to learn. We've got a handy video to show you. But the real way to
        learn is to check the tutorial that comes up when you try to rate articles.

    How does the rating system work?
    </center>
    </h1Class>

<p><strong>True:</strong> You factchecked the main claim in the article and figured out it was true. Great.
    Explain what research you did, and include links.
    </p>
<p><strong>Exaggerated:</strong> The main claim isn't a total lie, but it makes the situation seem way more
    extreme than it actually is. Maybe the headline is really extreme, maybe the article uses true facts to draw
        unrealistically wild conclusions.
    </p>
<p><strong>No Source:</strong> The article doesn't say where it got its information,
        and you can't figure it out either. Not a good sign.
</p>
<p><strong>Bad Source:</strong> The article tells you how it got its information, but the source isn't trustworthy
    — a random tweet maybe, or a small, really opinionated publication that a basic Google search
    tells you is not to be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>Otherwise False:</strong> Stuff can be false for other reasons. This is a catch-all for when something is false
        for some other reason.</p>
<p><strong>Not News:</strong> Opinion articles, short stories, poems, recipes ... These things aren't
    meant to be factchecked in the first place.</p>
