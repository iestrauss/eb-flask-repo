        Before you start: Pick out the main claim
        </center>
    </h1Class>
    <pClass><p>
    When you see an article, figure out the article's main point (it's usually in the headline).
    For instance, let's say you're scrolling through Facebook and come across this article:
    </p></pClass>

    <iframe name="Framename" src="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-odd-spotify-dogs/spotify-launches-playlists-for-dogs-left-home-alone-idUSKBN1ZE1D8" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto" class="frame-area">
    </iframe>
    <br>
    <pClass><p>
    The main claim is "Spotify is launching a playlist for dogs."
        <br><br>
        Now that you have the main claim, you're ready start investigating. To
        do that, you'll learn a bunch of techniques. Sometimes you'll want to use all of them, sometimes you'll only
        need one. Some techniques work better for some articles than articles. Some are quick, some are slow. You'll
        have to use your judgement to decide which techniques to use.
    </p></pClass>
    <h1Class>

    Technique 1: Find out where the article got its information.
    </center>
    </h1Class>
    <pClass><p>
    How do you know if Spotify is really launching a playlist for dogs? You look for clues.
          Chances are, the publication doesn't have spies on every street corner.
    They got their information somewhere. Any publication
    worth its salt will tell you how it found out what it found out.
    This line's key:
        </pClass></p>
<div class="quotebox">
    <h3Class>
        <em>
    The Swedish audio-streaming business company said it has
    launched a podcast featuring soothing music, "dog-directed praise."</h3Class>
    </em>
</div>
    <p>
    Then — and this is the important part — get off the article's website and <strong>trace it back to the source</strong>. If they
    got their information from a government report, find that government report.
    If they interviewed a scientist, look up that scientist. In this case, try to find this information on Spotify's website.
    </pClass>
    <pClass><p>
    It's often easier to Google than to search the website directly. Try Googling something like "spotify playlist dogs."
    </pClass></p>

    <img src="https://istrauss6.neocities.org/spotify-playlist.png" alt="google search for spotify playlist" width="80%">

    <pClass><p>
    The first result comes from spotify.com. Perfect.
    </pClass></p>

    Spotify is indeed launching a playlist for dogs. Case closed.
