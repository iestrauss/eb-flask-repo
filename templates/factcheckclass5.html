                <strong>First, find the central claim. </strong>
            </pClass>
            <pClass><p>
             It's usually the headline.

            <pClass>
                <strong>Technique 1. Find out where the article got its information.</strong>
            </pClass>
            <pClass><p>
            Figure out where the publication got its information and go there. Make sure:<br>
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the publication gave a source
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;2) the source really said what the article claims it said
                  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;3) the source would know what they're talking about
            </pClass></p>

            <pClass>
                <strong>Technique 2. Investigate the publication</strong>
            </pClass>
            <pClass><p>
             No publication is unbiased. Everybody gets money from somewhere. But some publications are completely and entirely
            fronts funded by special interests. So if you're looking at a publication you're not familiar with, check
                out its About Us page, Google, and Wikipedia for clues. If you see an article saying "Spinach cures all
                diseases," see if it's funded by a spinach farm.
            </pClass></p>
            <pClass>
                <strong>Technique 3. Google the story.</strong>
            </pClass>
            <pClass><p>
            Publications descend on major news like vultures. If any hugely shocking thing has happened, you can bet that
            many major publications will be covering it. So if you come across a shocking article, see who else is talking
                about it. If the only place covering it is some random publication you've never heard of, that's suspicious.</p>
        </div>

    <pClass><p>
        <strong>Do I have to do all this every time I investigate an article?</strong>
    </p>
        <p>
        No! You don't have to use all the tools all the time.
    You can decide whether to track down facts, research the publication, or simply Google the story.
          You'll be able to identify 90% of fake news in five minutes. They're just not that hard to figure out,
          as long as you know what to look for. And now you do!
        </p>
        <p><strong>How do I vote?</strong></p>
    I'm glad you asked. When you're looking at Facebook article posts, you'll a button that looks something like this:
        <br><br>
        <center>
            <img style="width: 200px" src="{{url_for('static', filename='pubscore.png')}}" align="middle" />
        </center>
        <br>

<!--            <div class="realorfakebutton">Real or Fake?</div></center>-->
        Sometimes it'll be red (meaning articles from that publication are often voted false), yellow (sometimes
        false), green (often true) or blue (few have voted on the publication). Sometimes it'll give the
        publication score.

        <br><br>
        In any case, click it, investigate the
        article, and vote. Every time you vote on an article,
        explain how your
        investigation went. What was suspicious? What sources came up empty?
        You'll always be able to return to this guide to brush up.

        <center>
            <img style="width: 450px" src="{{url_for('static', filename='vote.png')}}" align="middle" />
        </center>
        <br>

    Thank you so much for being the first round of detective recruits. Everyone's complaining about fake news, but you're
        actually doing something about it. This is untested (you're the testers),
        so I'm depending on you to point out bugs and things that need improvement, as well as things that are
        working. There's a

        <a href="/chat" style="color: #cc0000">feedback page</a>
         for that.
        Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to factcheck three articles. Godspeed.
